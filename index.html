                <p>We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the design works well
                    and
                    where it can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to
                    make
                    this design more efficient?”</p>

                    <h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>
                    <p>Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be improved but also
                        make revamps to the most critical parts of the design.</p>
                    <h2>Design Report</h2>
                    <p>We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a detailed visual
                        report with useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on
                        the design.</p>
                    <h2>Ways to Redesign</h2>
                    <p>We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers to
                        high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full
                        redesign and quick but effective improvements.</p>
